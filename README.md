# StyloLab

**Exploratory Text Analysis with AI & NLP**

StyloLab is a personal project focused on structured text analysis and comparison using a combination of classical NLP techniques and modern language model evaluation.  
The goal is not to build a polished product, but to explore how to design modular analysis pipelines that are transparent, reproducible, and technically sound.

## 🧠 Why StyloLab

Many text analysis tools are either:
- too complex to understand, or  
- too shallow to be meaningful

StyloLab bridges that gap by providing a clear and systematic approach to document processing, embedding retrieval, and evaluation of model-assisted analysis.

It demonstrates:
- thoughtful AI system design
- reproducible evaluation pipelines
- modular architecture for experimentation

## 🚀 What It Can Do

✔ Load and preprocess text documents  
✔ Extract stylistic and semantic features  
✔ Combine classical NLP techniques with LLM analysis  
✔ Evaluate and compare text outputs  
✔ Generate simple visual summaries and reports
